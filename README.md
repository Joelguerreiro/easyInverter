Early bird members:
- Hildo Guillardi Júnior (GUILLARDI JR., H.);
- Joel Filipe Guerreiro (GUERREIRO, J. F.);
- Fellipe Saldanha Garcia (GARCIA, F. S.);
- Arthur Crisóstomo Prates (PRATES, A. C.);
- José Antenor Pomilio (POMILIO, J. A.).

Max values (limitation) / general specifications:
- 10kW processing power;
- 600V of DC link;
- 50A in one phase;
- 200kHz switching frequency;
- 3.3V or 5V input logic control;
- Min dead-time & phase transistors interlock onboard;
- TWO extra relays;
- SMD topology with TO-247 transistor to easy replacement.

Previst powers proposes (look in power limitations):
1. 800V/10A -> To invertes grid conected aplications, motor control;
2. 400V/30A -> To invertes grid conected aplications, motor control;
3. 100V/100A -> DC/DC converters.

Previst uses, studies of:
1. DC/DC convertes, e.g., boost, buck, buck-boost, push-pull;
2. Power switching supplies, isolated topologies based on DC/DC convertes;
3. Resonant converters;
4. Single-phase inverter, using the two fisrt arms. Possibility to use the 3rd arm to synchonous connection to the grid and 4th to DC link boost/pre-load/discharge (discharge, pre-load and connection may be also performade by the two relays);
5. Three-phase inverter three wire connection. With possibility of extra arm to pre-load/discharge of the DC link, DC/DC boost or any extra aplication conected to the same DC link;
6. Three-phase inverter four wire connection (three-phase plus neutral);
7. Single-phase back-to-back inverter (to three-phase is necessary use two boards);
8. DOUBLE isolated single-phase inverters (independent DC links), to use as multilevel inverter aplications.
