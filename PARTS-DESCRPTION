This file describe the function of any part of the project.

# Main power supplier
Sheet: MainPowerSupplier.SchDoc

Provides the positive voltage to the isolated power supplier, necessary do the gate drive, and the +5V to
the logic circuits.


# Logic
Sheet: LogicCircuits.SchDoc

Provide:
1. The (if) necessary voltage level shift in the PWM / control signal (3.3V to 5V as HIGH LEVEL);
2. Erro memory (of each arm) and board disable. By selection, one erro will disable all board or only it arm;
3. Manual reset of the error (only if the board is not actived by the control connections);
4. PWM inputs, control of the relays, board enable and external reset connections in an RJ45 standard. Plus a extra conection
HEADER erros identification;
5. Indication (LEDs) of the board status: power-on, actived, no-error or error in an speficic phase;



# Dead-time + interlock
Sheet: DeadTimeDriver_Leg.SchDoc

Provide:
1. The minimum dead-time to any arm of the inveter (configurable). It is used the inerent trigger
level of the gate input and a RC circuit plus DIODE to create a delay in only one transition;
2. The interlock (may be disable) between the HIGH SIDE and LOW SIDE group of transistors;

# Isolated power supplier
Sheet: GateDrivePowerSupply.SchDoc

Provide the isolated voltage to gate the transistores plus the +5V to the logic and protections circuits.

# Gate-drive + protections


Sheet:

# Power
Sheet: MainPower.SchDoc

Provide:
1. The main conections of the DC links and transistores to create the desidered topology of study;
2. The capacitors conections and measurement points.

# Auxiliary
Sheet: Auxiliary.SchDoc

Provide TWO extra relays with them NO and NC connections.
